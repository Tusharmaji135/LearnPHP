# PHP & MySQL CRUD Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains my learning exercises and projects from the **PHP & MySQL** tutorial series. The main goal of the tutorial was to understand how to interact with databases using PHP, perform basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations, and establish a MySQL database connection within a PHP application.

## Learning Topics

1. **PHP Basics**
   - Variables, data types, and operators  
   - Control structures (if, else, loops)  
   - Functions, arrays, and superglobals  
   - Handling forms and user input

2. **MySQL Basics**
   - Creating databases and tables  
   - Performing queries to insert, retrieve, update, and delete data  
   - Using `MySQLi` and `PDO` to connect to MySQL

3. **CRUD Operations in PHP**
   - **Create**: Adding records to the database  
   - **Read**: Fetching records from the database  
   - **Update**: Modifying existing records in the database  
   - **Delete**: Removing records from the database

## What Iâ€™ve Learned

- Connecting PHP to MySQL databases using `MySQLi`  
- Performing CRUD operations in PHP  
- Working with HTML and CSS to create user interfaces  
- Basic validation and sanitization of user input  
- Dynamically displaying database records on web pages  
- **jQuery**: Implemented various jQuery functions, including events, HTML manipulation, CSS methods, effects, and advanced functions

## Projects Completed

- **News Blog Website**: Developed a news blog website integrated with PHP and MySQL, featuring:
  - Admin and regular user roles  
  - Functionality to add, edit, and delete posts  
  - User authentication with login/logout  
  - Search tab, recent posts, and more features for content management

## Future Plans

I plan to enhance my PHP and MySQL knowledge by creating additional projects and exploring:

- A complete PHP-based CRUD application  
- Advanced topics such as **prepared statements** for security, **file handling**, and **user authentication**
