# PHP & MySQL CRUD Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains the learning and practice exercises from the **PHP & MySQL** tutorial series. The goal of the tutorial was to learn how to interact with databases using PHP, perform basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations, and connect a MySQL database to a PHP application.

## Learning Topics

1. **PHP Basics**  
   - Variables, data types, and operators  
   - Control structures (if, else, loops)  
   - Functions, arrays, and superglobals  
   - Handling forms and user input

2. **MySQL Basics**  
   - Creating databases and tables  
   - Performing queries to insert, retrieve, update, and delete data  
   - Using `MySQLi` and `PDO` to connect to MySQL

3. **CRUD Operations in PHP**  
   - **Create**: Adding records to the database  
   - **Read**: Fetching records from the database  
   - **Update**: Modifying existing records in the database  
   - **Delete**: Removing records from the database

## What Iâ€™ve Learned

- Connecting PHP to MySQL databases using `MySQLi`  
- Performing CRUD operations in PHP  
- Working with HTML and CSS to create user interfaces  
- Basic validation and sanitization of user input  
- Displaying database records dynamically on web pages  

## Future Plans

Once I create a project based on this tutorial, I plan to:

- Develop a simple PHP-based CRUD application  
- Learn more advanced topics like **prepared statements** for better security, **file handling**, and **authentication**
